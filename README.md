# Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI - Course Repository

This repository contains all the code, AI agents, and resources that I have built and worked on during the **Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI** course.

## Course Overview

This course covered how to design and implement multi-agent systems using **crewAI**, an open-source library for building AI agent teams. It course focused on automating complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating multiple AI agents to perform business processes that are typically carried out by teams of people.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Designing AI Agent Teams**: Learn to go beyond single AI models and create teams of specialized agents.
- **Roles and Memory Management**: Assign specific roles to each agent and provide them with short-term, long-term, and shared memory.
- **Task Division**: Break down complex processes into smaller tasks, assigning them to agents with the right expertise.
- **Guardrails and Error Management**: Effectively handle common AI issues like errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops.
- **Cooperative Agent Workflows**: Use agents working in parallel, in series, or hierarchically to complete complex workflows.
- **Automation of Business Processes**: Combine these concepts and build multi-agent systems to automate tasks such as customer support, content creation, event planning, and more using multiple agents working together.

### Business Processes Automated:
Throughout the course, I applied multi-agent systems to automate six common business processes:

1. **Research, Writing, and Editing Technical Articles**
2. **Automating Customer Support Inquiries**  
3. **Executing Customer Outreach Campaigns**  
4. **Planning and Organizing Events**  
5. **Performing Financial Analysis**
6. **Tailoring Resumes and Interview Preparation**  

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a record of the work I completed during the course. It includes all the code, AI agents, configurations, and tools developed and used to automate the business processes mentioned above. The repo serves as a collection of practical examples that demonstrate how to implement and manage multi-agent systems in real-world applications.

### What Youâ€™ll Find in This Repo:
- **AI Agents**: Various agents designed to perform specific roles within the multi-agent systems.
- **Code for Automating Processes**: Scripts and functions that automate tasks like resume tailoring, customer support, and more.
- **Configurations and Tools**: Pre-built tools assigned to agents (e.g., web search, data processing tools) to enhance performance.
- **Sample Workflows**: Examples of how agents cooperate to achieve complex outcomes, working in parallel, series, or hierarchically.
- **Error Handling and Guardrails**: Code to ensure that the agents handle errors, hallucinations, and infinite loops gracefully.

## Expected Outcomes

To have designed and implemented several multi-agent systems capable of assisting with a variety of business tasks. The key outcomes I expect to achieve include:
- Automating common business processes with a team of specialized agents.
- Gaining practical experience with building and managing AI agent teams.
- Understanding key principles of multi-agent systems, including task division, cooperation, and error management.
